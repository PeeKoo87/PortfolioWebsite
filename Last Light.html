            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Last Light is the second year school portfolio project, the game was made with Unreal Engine 5 <br>
            using blueprints given the time frame of 8 weeks. Graphics were mostly made by the art team in exclusion of the last boss, <br>
            which was downloaded from the Unreal engine asset store.<br>
            <br>
            Last Light is a fully working demo, but will still be polished further as it has been an excellent project to practice on. <br>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            The game is played from isometric view, controls are keyboard and mouse. <br>
            Aim of the game is to loot items and clear the dungeon all the way to the boss,<br>
            while avoiding devious traps and battling foes on the way.
            Implemented mechanics: Fast/Heavy attack,block,abilities(1-3 + ult,dodge roll)<br><br>

        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>
            Low poly graphics were chosen for the game given the timeframe.<br>
            The art team made assets for the game from scratch,<br>
            with sole exception being the last boss Azrael. <br>

<!-------AI---------->
<div id="AI">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Enemy AI</h2>
        <p>
            Ai logic was made using a behaviour tree for streamlined implementation, <br>
            basic enemies(pawns) have a simpler implementation of following and attacking the player, <br>
            while the more advanced halberdiers(rooks) have logic for better positioning and combo attacks. <br>
            The boss itself, has a more complex system to teleport around, ranged AOE attacks and a melee combo.

<div id="inventorySystem">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Inventory System</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Spatial Inventory</h3>
        <p>
            The spatial inventory system was my personal assignment for the project. <br>
            It is made in a modular fashion, so it can be implemented on objects such as chests, pouches, <br>
            and the character itself. <br>
            <br>
            The inventory system is controlled by drag and dropping items within the inventory grid, <br>
            equipment slots and containers possibly found around the map. <br>

            Inventory system logic functions by calculating inventory tile sizes and indexes for item allocation, <br>
            items within the grid and slots are handled as objects within a widgets that store the item data. <br>

            When equipping or dropping items out of the inventory items are spawned from the stored data and spawned as blueprint items. <br>
        </p><br>
        <img src="assets/images/Last_Light_InventoryComponent.png" height="600" width="1500" alt=""/>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Items And Weapons</h3>
        <p>
            Items implement a widget for storing data and to enable drag dropping. <br>
            When within the inventory the object consists of thumbnails for the base icon, rotated icon, and the actual object. <br>
            Items spawned outside the inventory implement an inherited item structure derived from a parent item and divided to child classes, <br>
            such as weapon base-,shield base- and armor base classes(armor not implemented) for more control and ease of use. <br>
        </p><br>
        <img src="assets/images/Last_Light_WBItem.png" height="600" width="1500" alt=""/>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Interactions</h3>
        <p>
            Interactions were done by implementing an interface and a widget to indicate the action available for the interactable item, <br>
            interaction base and overlap checks were implemented within the parent item object to reduce the amount of redundant code and repetition. <br>
            Items implementing the interface have the possibility to customize interaction texts within the blueprints for better indicators on the ongoing action. <br>
