                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The game is my first actual game I have ever made, <br>
                Grumpo's Adventure is my first year school portfolio project assignment. <br>
                I started with only the basic knowledge of c# and unity at the start
                of the project and had to learn as the project progressed. <br>
                While the game is still in demo phase it has been a wonderful experience,
                although quite challenging considering the timeframe. <br>
                <br>
                In the sections below I will go in to detail on the game itself,
                skills and software I needed to learn for making the game.</p>

<div id="graphics">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>Graphics were partly made using photoshop and most of the assets are from unity asset store, <br>
         player character and the goblin enemy both have bone structures, <br>
         and were animated through manipulating the bone structures within unity animator.<br>
         Backgrounds have a parallax effect implemented on them to make a smoother feel while playing the game,<br>
         backgrounds and level graphics have been imported from unity asset store using free assets for this project.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--------Audio----------->
<div id="audio">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Audio</h2>
        <p>Sounds for the game were implemented using FMOD,
         i started learning FMOD usage for the project and still has room for improvement, although i did get a grasp of the basics. <br>
         I Implemented the sounds for the player and enemy within the animator for more precise timing, <br>
         i did fiddle around with implementing sound effects through code, <br>
         but since this was my first solo project using animator was within my range of skills and easiest to implement within the timeframe of the project.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!--------Animation------->
<div id="animation">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Animation</h2>
        <p>Animations within the game function based on a statemachine, I found it the most efficient way of doing things regarding this game.<br>
         The animation logic is separated within base states and substates to keep the process more organized,<br>
         player animations are divided to two main states ground- and air states which separate things like air attack animations, <br>
         falling, basic movement and attack patterns.</p>

<!-------Save and UI------->
<div id="saveAndUi">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Save And UI</h2>
        <p>
            Save and UI functionality was the most challenging part of the project, the save system in game uses a data persistence system,<br>
            which saves all collected item, player position and encrypts save game data. <br>
            The game data is saved in a json file which encrypted and decrypted during the save and load functions, <br>
            items have their own unique randomly generated id:s to make sure there are no duplicate values within the serialized dictionaries within the script. <br>
            UI functions are operated through code as one would expect and were fairly straightforward to implement, <br>
            Menu option are separated to their own respective scripts to keep the functions organized and easier to read.<br>
            In regard of the data persistence scripts i have to thank Shaped By Rain Studios on youtube for very easy to understand tutorials, <br>
            they were very educational and easy to follow despite the very complex subject of data persistence.<br>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Grumpo's Adventure has be quite the adventure as a project, i had to learn most skills from the very beginning. <br>
          FMOD was a completely unfamiliar software to work with, although while making this game i learnt the very basics on how to operate it, <br>
          a good skill to have in my opinion, even if only on the very basic level. <br>
          The process of making Grumpo's adventure also deepend my undestanding of unity and c# programming, <br>
          although it has been an intense process it has been a very exciting project to work on!<br>
          <br>
          On hindsight Fmod might have been a slight overkill on the project since most sound effect could have been implemented <br>
          in a more simple fashion through animator and code itself. <br>
          Slight fumbling on the order of things to be made happened aswell but, i did learn my lesson, better planning makes for a smoother process!.<br>
          <br>
          The game is still a work in progress, but I intend to polish the game and my skills in the process.<br>
          All in all if has been a very fruitful project in regard of gaining perspective and insight on game development process as a whole.
