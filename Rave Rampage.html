            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Rave Rampage was our third year portfolio project, the game was made in unity and is a fully functioning demo.<br>
            We are planning to continue this project hopefully to a full release ready game.<br>
            The project was a great opportunity to learn, and I had little to no experience working on a game AI.<br>
            I am happy with how it turned out within the timeframe, and it was a fun project to work on!.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>You step into the role of a mercenary hunting the infamous drug lord and rave DJ Baron Bass,<br>
            fight the horde of his minions in the increasingly difficult waves as they try to stop you.<br>
            Grab a drink from the bar between waves for a quick boost or buy upgrades to give an edge for the battles to come!.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The game is a fast-paced shooter/slasher with a high focus on movement,
        to mention a few mechanics: varying damage based on weapon used on enemy types, fast-paced movement with sliding,jumping and dashing.<br>
        Special skills such as: burst shot for the gun and the slashing dash for the sword.</p>
        Deflecting bullets with your sword and a short bullet time ability while aiming your gun.

        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>
            The graphics are high poly, with a diesel punk/rave theme.

<div id="AI">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Enemy AI</h2>
        <p>
            I was in charge of the AI implementations for the game, The AI was done with a handwritten finite state machine.<br>
            This was my first attempt to make AI for a game and was a very interesting endeavour,<br>
            most enemies use the same base logic with varying attack logic.<br>
            The Enemy parameters and implementation was made using scriptable objects for easier customization and definition.<br>
            AI behaviour was divided into three categories: Melee, Ranged and Boss.<br>
            Melee:<br>
            Melee enemies have functionalities for basic spin attack, charge/jump attack, chasing and customized navmesh link traversal.<br>
            Ranged:<br>
            Ranged enemies have base implementations depending on ranged enemy type, there are currently only two types of shooters: Basic and a sniper.<br>
            Basic: shooting, reloading, chase, enemy unit avoidance and inverse kinematics for aiming.<br>
            Sniper: snipers have the same functionalities as the basic version,<br>
            but additionally favor specified sniper vantage points on higher ground instead of chasing.<br>
            Boss:<br>
            The Boss enemy is still under development but has basic functionality implemented to it,<br>
            features already implemented are: chasing, multiple attack patterns(charge,belly flop, punches and a ground slam),<br>
            the boss uses a custom animation synchronization for chopping up animations into smaller segments,<br>
            this was done to improve control over the animations for i.e: punch windups and the actual punch segment of the animation.<br>

        <h2>Audio</h2>

        <br>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            The game has dynamic music, it changes according to the players current combo rating,<br>
            getting more intense as the combo goes higher.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>SFX</h3>
        <p>Basic sound effects were added to all interactions, attacks and movement for both player and the enemies. </p>
